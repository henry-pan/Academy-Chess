# Academy Chess
### Authors: Henry Pan, Michael Dean

This is a terminal chess program written in Ruby, made at App Academy as a pair programming project ([seen here](https://github.com/henry-pan/AA-Classwork/tree/main/W4D3)).

## How to Play
In the terminal, run `ruby game.rb`.

Use the arrow keys to move the cursor, and press `enter` or `spacebar` to select a piece. After selecting a piece, use `enter` or `spacebar` to choose where to move the piece.

## Rules
This version only features basic rules and does not yet implement castling, en passant, or pawn promotion.
